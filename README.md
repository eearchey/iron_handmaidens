	<h3>CS 495 Spring 2022 Project</h3>
	<p>This project is designed to serve the Iron Hand PhD project, run by Ifeanyi Okpala and Adullahi Ibrahim. The Iron Hand aims to prevent back, wrist, and shoulder pain from working in construction.<br> This project will provide data visualization for the project, showing relationships between data such as RMS (root mean squared). We also have a stretch goal of utilizing Maching Learning to predict under what circumstances the data was collected, such as if the user were wearing the Iron Hand or what the temperature of the room was.<br>This project will allow the user to upload CSV files of data, which will then be shown in plots that showcase the relationships between data.<br>This project is built on the Django Framework, using HTML and CSS to build the frontend. In the backend, Python will process the data using Pandas, Plotly, and Scipy.</p>
