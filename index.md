### Project Goals
1. Have users upload their data via a web interface.
2. Deliver data visualization to the Iron Hand PhD team.
3. Stretch: Use ML to predict circumstances under which data was collected (i.e. temperature, presence of Iron Hand).

### Approach
1. User goes to the Iron Handmaidens website.
2. User uploads a csv file with data of their choosing.
3. Our application processes the data in the backend and calculates relationships.
4. Relationships between data are plotted into an interface the user can see.

### Tools
1. Django
2. AWS (SNS, Lightsail?)
3. Plotly
